## Project Description
Utilising learnings covered in week 4, the assignment was to create a multiple choice quiz which demonstrated javascript functionalities explored in week 4 as well as become familiar with parts of a typical coding assessment which may include multiple choice questions as part of an interview process for a developer role.

## Functionality
On the home page, when the user clicks the start button, a timer starts and they are presented with the first question. 

WHEN the user answers the question, they are presented with another question and the processbar and text above indicates how far the user has progressed, until the end of the quiz is reached, or the timer has reached 0 seconds. 

WHEN the user answers a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over

WHEN the game is over, the user can save my initials and my score

## Actual Behaviour
WHEN the user clicks the start button, a timer starts and they are presented with a question
